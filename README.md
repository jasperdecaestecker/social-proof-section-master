# Frontend Mentor - Social proof section solution

This is a solution to the [Social proof section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-proof-section-6e0qTv_bA). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## My Solution

Used [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) (11ty) to build this page. Altough overkill for this page its a good exercise for more complex sites that can benefit from a SSG

## Running the site
`npm install` to install dependencies

`npx @11ty/eleventy --serve` -> Boot up a Browsersync web server to apply changes (with watch)

`npx @11ty/eleventy` -> builds project (output dist) -> see .eleventy.js
